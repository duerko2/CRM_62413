AI-CRM - Instead of legacy CRM systems, a AI-CRM system makes decisions autonomously. 
"AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention."

Conclusion:
"This study integrated institutional theory and the RBV and developed a model showing how successful implementation of AI-CRM in B2B relationship management could impact organizations' performance and ultimately their competitive advantage"
